# Learning React

### Developing

Run `npm install` to install server dependencies.

Run `npm start` to start the development server

Run `npm run serve:dist` to run build code locally

## Just build the dist version and copy static files
npm run dist

## Testing
npm test

## Auto-run unit tests on file changes
npm run test:watch

## Lint all files in src (also automatically done AFTER tests are run)
npm run lint

## Clean up the dist directory
npm run clean

## Just copy the static assets
npm run copy
